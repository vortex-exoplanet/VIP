VIP - Vortex Image Processing package
=====================================

Introduction
------------

``VIP`` is a package/pipeline for angular, reference star and spectral
differential imaging for exoplanet/disk detection through high-contrast imaging.
``VIP`` is being developed in Python 2.7. There is effort ongoing for Python 3
compatibility.

Most of ``VIP``'s functionalities are mature but it doesn't mean it's
free from bugs. The code will continue evolving and therefore all the feedback
and contributions will be greatly appreciated. If you want to report a bug,
suggest or add a functionality please create an issue or send a pull request on
the Github repository.


Jupyter notebook tutorial

``VIP`` tutorial (Jupyter notebook) is available in `this repository
<https://github.com/carlgogo/vip-tutorial>`_ and can be visualized online `here
<http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/carlgogo/vip-tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial1_VIP_adi_pre-postproc_fluxpos_ccs.ipynb>`_.
If you are new to the Jupyter notebook application read the `beginner guide
<https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html>`_.
TL;DR download the tutorial from its repository and from the terminal run:
