What is VIP?
------------
``VIP`` stands for Vortex Image Processing.
It is a python package for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar disks.
VIP is compatible with Python 3.10 and 3.11 (Python 2 compatibility dropped with VIP 0.9.9, and Python 3.7 compatibility dropped with VIP 1.4.3).

The goal of VIP is to integrate open-source, efficient, easy-to-use and
well-documented implementations of high-contrast image processing algorithms to
the interested scientific community. The main repository of VIP resides on
`GitHub <https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP>`_, the standard for scientific
open source code distribution, using Git as a version control system.

Most of VIP's functionalities are mature but
it does not mean it is free from bugs. The code is continuously evolving and
therefore feedback/contributions are greatly appreciated. Please refer to `these instructions <https://vip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contact.html>`_ if you want to report
a bug, ask a question, suggest a new functionality or contribute to the code (the latter is particularly welcome)!
