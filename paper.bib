	abstract = {Reference star differential imaging (RDI) is a powerful strategy for high-contrast imaging. Using example observations taken with the vortex coronagraph mode of Keck/NIRC2 in L‧ band, we demonstrate that RDI provides improved sensitivity to point sources at small angular separations compared to angular differential imaging (ADI). Applying RDI to images of the low-mass stellar companions HIP 79124 C (192 mas separation, ΔL‧ = 4.01) and HIP 78233 B (141 mas separation, ΔL‧ = 4.78), the latter a first imaging detection, increases the significance of their detections by up to a factor of 5 with respect to ADI. We compare methods for reference frame selection and find that pre-selection of frames improves detection significance of point sources by up to a factor of 3. In addition, we use observations of the circumstellar disks around MWC 758 and 2MASS J16042165-2130284 to show that RDI allows for accurate mapping of scattered light distributions without self-subtraction artifacts.},

@article{Dahlqvist:2021,
	abstract = {Context. Most of the high-contrast imaging (HCI) data-processing techniques used over the last 15 years have relied on the angular differential imaging (ADI) observing strategy, along with subtraction of a reference point spread function (PSF) to generate exoplanet detection maps. Recently, a new algorithm called regime switching model (RSM) map has been proposed to take advantage of these numerous PSF-subtraction techniques; RSM uses several of these techniques to generate a single probability map. Selection of the optimal parameters for these PSF-subtraction techniques as well as for the RSM map is not straightforward, is time consuming, and can be biased by assumptions made as to the underlying data set. <BR /> Aims: We propose a novel optimisation procedure that can be applied to each of the PSF-subtraction techniques alone, or to the entire RSM framework. <BR /> Methods: The optimisation procedure consists of three main steps: (i) definition of the optimal set of parameters for the PSF-subtraction techniques using the contrast as performance metric, (ii) optimisation of the RSM algorithm, and (iii) selection of the optimal set of PSF-subtraction techniques and ADI sequences used to generate the final RSM probability map. <BR /> Results: The optimisation procedure is applied to the data sets of the exoplanet imaging data challenge, which provides tools to compare the performance of HCI data-processing techniques. The data sets consist of ADI sequences obtained with three state-of-the-art HCI instruments: SPHERE, NIRC2, and LMIRCam. The results of our analysis demonstrate the interest of the proposed optimisation procedure, with better performance metrics compared to the earlier version of RSM, as well as to other HCI data-processing techniques.},

@article{Pueyo:2016,
	abstract = {A new class of high-contrast image analysis algorithms that empirically fit and subtract systematic noise has lead to recent discoveries of faint exoplanet/substellar companions and scattered light images of circumstellar disks. These methods are extremely efficient at enhancing the detectability of a faint astrophysical signal, but they generally create systematic biases in their observed properties. This paper provides a general solution for this outstanding problem. We present an analytical derivation of a linear expansion that captures the impact of astrophysical over-subtraction or self-subtraction in current image analysis techniques. We examine the general case for which the reference images of the astrophysical scene move azimuthally and/or radially across the field of view as a result of the observation strategy. Our new method is based on perturbing the covariance matrix underlying any least-squares speckles problem, and propagating this perturbation through the data analysis algorithm. Most of the work in this paper is presented in the Principal Component Analysis framework, but it can be easily generalized to methods relying on the linear combination of images (instead of eigenmodes). Based on this linear expansion, which is obtained in the most general case, we then demonstrate practical applications of this new algorithm. We first consider the spectral extraction of faint point sources in IFS data and illustrate, using public Gemini Planet Imager commissioning data, that our novel perturbation-based Forward Modeling, which we named Karhunen Loeve Image Processing (KLIP-FM), can indeed alleviate algorithmic biases. We then apply KLIP-FM to the detection of point sources and show how it decreases the rate of false negatives while keeping the rate of false positives unchanged when compared to classical KLIP. This can potentially have important consequences on the design of follow-up strategies of ongoing direct imaging surveys.},
